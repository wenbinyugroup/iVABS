Parameter study of a spar laminate of an airfoil cross-section
================================================================

Problem description
-------------------

This example studies the effects of variation of spar layups on the beam properties.


Design variables
------------------

This example considers a box spar structure as the base design.
See :ref:`section-ivabs_temp_airfoil_gbox_uni` for more details of this base design.
Cross-sections with an airfoil SC1095 are studied.
The spar has a width of 20% of the chord length, spanning from 60% to 80% of the chord.
The spar is made of long fiber reinforced composites and regions before and after the spar are filled with a honeycomb material.
Origin of the reference frame for cross-sectional analysis is placed at the quarter chord for all designs.

Two parameters are considered to inspect their effects on beam properties: fiber angle and layer thickness of the spar.
The fiber angle varies from -90 to 90 degrees.
The number of plies of the composite lamina is used to parameterize the layer thickness, which can be a value from a series of integer numbers.
A full factorial sampling method is used to generate specific cross-sectional designs in the 2D design space and call cross-sectional analyses.
Widely used beam properties such as stiffness and shear center are considered, whose values are recorded for each specific set of design parameters.
