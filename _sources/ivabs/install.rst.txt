Download & Installation
========================

Download
-------------

iVABS can be dowloaded from `its Release Page on github <https://github.com/wenbinyugroup/ivabs/releases>`_.
The directory ``Assets`` contains the installation files you need to download for different versions.
Please ignore ``Source code (zip)`` and ``Source code (tar.gz)`` because they just contain files used to generate this documentation site.
Package with ``installer`` in the file name contains a single executable for the automatic installation.
Package with ``portable`` in the file name contains all the files in an archive requiring manual extraction and setting up. Packages are released for both Windows and Linux.

Prerequisites
-------------

**VABS**

- Request VABS from `AnalySwift <http://analyswift.com/software-trial/>`_ and follow the VABS instruction to install.
- The VABS installation directory ``VABS_ROOT`` should be in the environment variable (``PATH`` for Windows/Linux and ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` for Linux) so that iVABS can invoke the VABS executable. 
- Request license from `AnalySwift <http://analyswift.com/software-trial/>`_.
  License should also be placed inside ``VABS_ROOT``.


**Python**

Python 3.6 or above is required for iVABS to run.
Packages ``numpy`` (Version 1.19 or above), ``scipy`` (Version 1.1 or above), and ``pyyaml`` (Version 5.4 or above) should also be properly installed.
For help on configuring the Python environment, see :doc:`/ivabs/install/python_setup`.

.. note::

  Minimum versions for Python packages are roughly determined by checking some key features needed by iVABS.
  If the versions are too low or unnecessarily high, please let the developers know.
