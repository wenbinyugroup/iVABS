Quick Start
============

..  note::

    In this documentation, ``IVABS_ROOT`` refers to the root directory of iVABS after installation.




Run iVABS with a simple example
-------------------------------

Start the shell/terminal that is configured during the installation.
Please refer to :ref:`section-ivabs_install` for more information.

    If you are using Python virtual environment managed by Anaconda (see :doc:`/install/python_setup`), you need to activate it first.
    For example, if Python 3.6 and all dependencies are installed in a virtual environment named ``py3ivabs``, then activate it using

    ..  code-block:: shell

        conda activate py3ivabs

Go to the directory ``IVABS_ROOT/examples/anl_cs_airfoil_box``

..  code-block:: shell

    cd IVABS_ROOT/examples/anl_cs_airfoil_box

Run the example using the following command.


..  code-block:: shell

    ivabs main.yml --mode 1

If iVABS has been installed properly, a single cross-sectional analysis will be carried out and the result can be found in the output file ``main.out``.

.. If iVABS has been installed properly, it will generate a complete list of output files shown in the section below (:ref:`section-start_file_out`).
.. In the file ``cs_param_study.out``, the following message should appear at the end of the file.

.. ..  code-block:: none

..     <<<<< Iterator multidim_parameter_study completed.
..     <<<<< Environment execution completed.
..     DAKOTA execution time in seconds:
..     Total CPU        =     34.003 [parent =     34.003, child =          0]
..     Total wall clock =     34.003

.. Running time usually takes less than one minute depending on the computer.

.. Please refer to :ref:`section-ivabs_example_quickstart_param_study` for a detailed explanation of this example. 



iVABS running options
---------------------

The general command syntax to run an iVABS study is

..  code-block:: shell

    ivabs <main_input_file> [options]

Use the option ``-h`` to see the list of available options.

There are two running modes:

#. Mode 0 is the default mode. It will generate Dakota input and run iterative analysis.

   ..  code-block:: shell

    ivabs <main_input_file>


#. Mode 1 runs a single analysis.

   ..  code-block:: shell

    ivabs <main_input_file> --mode 1

.. #. Mode 2 only generates Dakota input. The process stops after generating the Dakota input.

..    ..  code-block:: shell

..     python run.py main_input.yml 2
